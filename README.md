# General Information
This is a project where I created and normalised an SQL database
for baseball data and subsequently used it to answer some interesting questions
about baseball. 
The data was provided by Dataquest and also some suggestions to carry out the project were given.
You can find the code and my comments in the notebook `analysis.ipynb`.
The code is written in Python and uses the `sqlite3` module to execute SQL queries.
